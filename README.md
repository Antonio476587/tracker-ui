PRO_MERN_STACK_2 with Vasan Subramanian

This is an Issue Tracker's UI, you can clone it afterwards you could to run the npm run dev-all command if you're on linux, otherwise you can run this sequence:
# npm run compile
# npm run watch-server-hmr || npm run start
If you want to extract all the potential, clone the https://github.com/Antonio476587/tracker-api/ repo to have the data, note: You have to add a MongoDB database and create the initial data.
